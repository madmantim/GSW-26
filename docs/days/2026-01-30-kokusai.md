## Attractions / Activities

### ♨️ Jozankei Onsen (On the way home)

**🏆 Top Pick: Hoheikyo Onsen**
- ¥1,300 adults / ¥600 kids
- **HUGE outdoor rotenburo** (holds 200 people!) with stunning mountain views
- **Tattoo-friendly** ✓
- Day-trip only facility — no hotel guests, so it's all about the baths
- Free shuttle from Jozankei town
- Indoor pool is carved sandstone, outdoor is the showstopper
- [📍 Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/?q=Hoheikyo+Onsen)

**Good budget options:**
- **Matsunoyu** — ¥800, cheapest proper onsen
- **Yunohana Jozankeiden** — ¥980, variety of different baths
- **Hatagoya Shoten** — ¥980, adults only (13+)

**What to know:**
- Bring your own towel or rent one (usually ¥200-300)
- Wash thoroughly before entering baths
- No swimwear — it's naked 
- Tattoos: Hoheikyo is explicitly OK; others may give you looks but rarely enforce
- Most have coin lockers for valuables

**Free foot baths** if you just want a taste: Futami-no-ashiyu and Taro-no-yu

**Location:** Hoheikyo is about 10 mins past main Jozankei — worth the extra trip for that massive outdoor bath! 🧖‍♂️

### 🍺 Sapporo Beer Museum
Adjacent to Beer Garden, worth a look before dinner

## Backup Plan

**If Kokusai closed:** Teine Highland (closer) or Kiroro (further but reliable)

_Day 2 of skiing. Legs finding their rhythm._
