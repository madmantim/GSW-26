## Terrain & Access Rules

### Off-Piste Policy
✅ **ALLOWED — with registration required**

**Official designated off-piste zones:**
- Multiple marked off-piste areas on both Tower Mountain and Tomamu Mountain
- **Registration required:** Must register at Resort Center before accessing
- **GPS tracking app:** Download required app (allows ski patrol to track location)
- **Season:** Off-piste areas typically open from mid-January onwards
- **Rating:** Resort rates all off-piste as "expert," though realistically they're more **advanced** (not super steep, no cliffs/cornices)

**Off-piste terrain characteristics:**
- Well-gladed trees (good spacing for snowboards)
- Some bamboo obstacles (fun when snow is deep, annoying when it's shallow)
- Wedge-shaped zones on Tomamu Mountain side (try to steer you away from creek)
- Wide former piste areas on Tower Mountain side (old lift line access via short hike or traverse)

⚠️ **Early season note:** Resort doesn't get huge early snow volumes like coastal resorts, so expect bamboo navigation in December/early January

### Sidecountry/Backcountry
✅ **PERMITTED — with proper registration**

**This is a MAJOR highlight of Tomamu!**

**Top backcountry gate (past Cloud Walk):**
- **PRISTINE POWDER** — north-facing aspect (not sun-affected like in-bounds)
- ~300m vertical for sidecountry access
- Wide open trees where you can fly
- Some bushy zones, but navigable
- **Snowboarders:** Extensive traversing required (may get less vertical)
- **Ski tourers:** Can continue to valley floor for full descent (bliss!)

**Frontside backcountry gate (via Cloud Walk):**
- Varied terrain when fresh
- Good ski touring/splitboard access to adjacent mountain
- Multiple bowls open up with touring setup
- Can dabble in trees and pop back in-bounds
- **Warning:** Lower sections are REALLY FLAT (slog for boarders, bring touring gear if possible)
- Former ski area below for road/train pickup if you commit

**Requirements:**
- Submit climbing plans at main lodge
- Proper avalanche awareness (though Tomamu is not super avalanche-prone)
- ⚠️ **Not for us if we don't have touring/ava gear** — but worth considering hiring guide

## Hot Tips: Powder Stashes & Tree Runs

### Best Strategy
🏔️ **The real goods at Tomamu are OUTSIDE the ropes**

**Powder game plan:**
- **Early AM:** Hit sidecountry gates FIRST (top gate = best powder, north-facing aspect)
- **Mid-morning:** Work the designated off-piste zones (trees on Tomamu Mountain side)
- **Afternoon:** If sunny, avoid Tower Mountain front side (south-facing, gets baked)
- **Powder days:** Tower Mountain trees are wide and fun, but quality drops faster in sun

### Snowboarder-Specific Beta
- ✅ Tree spacing is generally good (well-gladed)
- ✅ In-bounds off-piste zones are board-friendly
- ⚠️ Sidecountry requires traversing — may need to hike/pole certain sections
- ⚠️ Backcountry commitment means FLAT runouts (consider touring gear or be prepared to hike out)
- ✅ Romance Chair is hilariously slow (brings new meaning to "chair time")

### Weather & Wind Notes
- **Gondola:** Old and poorly maintained, prone to **wind holds** (especially during southerly storms)
- **When gondola closes:** Tomamu Express quad gets slammed with queues
- **Snow from southerlies:** Tomamu gets decent accumulation from southerly systems (better than Furano)
- **When it swings westerly:** Game on at Tomamu (wind calms, lifts reopen)

### Tree Zones (In-Bounds)
**Tower Mountain side:**
- Wide area including former lift-serviced piste
- Can hike up old lift line or traverse in for fewer turns
- ⚠️ **Aspect:** South-facing = sun-baked after clear days (prioritize morning or cloudy days)

**Tomamu Mountain side:**
- Wedge-shaped zones (keep away from creek)
- More consistent quality
- Better tree density

## Best Runs & Areas

### DON'T MISS
- **Top backcountry gate** (north-facing sidecountry) — THE highlight, pristine powder
- **Off-piste tree zones** — register and explore all designated areas
- **Cloud Walk backcountry access** — for adventurers with proper gear
- **Terrace of Frosted Tree** — spectacular hoarfrost views at 1,088m (KUMO Cafe at top)

### SKIP IF TIGHT ON TIME
- **Black runs (No Gravity, others)** — only 4 blacks, max 35°, not that steep, often bumped up
- **Tower Mountain groomers on sunny days** — south-facing, gets crusty
- **Romance Chair** — slowest lift in Japan (use only as connector if necessary)

### RECOVERY RUNS
- **Silver Bell → Beginner's Choice** — 4,200m, gentle cruiser, longest run in resort
- **Gondola descent trail** — winding mellow blue from top to base (watch for snow scooters!)
- **Nipo Chair area** — super gentle, in front of The Tower

### FOR NON-SKIERS / EASY DAYS
- **Terrace of Frosted Tree** — gondola up, amazing views, KUMO Cafe
- **Ice Village** — evening wonderland (open ~Dec 10 - March 14)
- **Mina-Mina Beach** — 80m x 30m indoor wave pool, 30°C+ temp (summer in winter!)

## Gotchas & Quirks

### ⚠️ GONDOLA WIND HOLDS
**MAJOR ISSUE** — Old gondola is poorly maintained, goes on wind hold frequently
- Happens especially during southerly storms
- When gondola closes, Tomamu Express quad gets SLAMMED with queues
- **Backup plan:** Focus on Tower Mountain lifts (if wind isn't too severe there too)
- Check lift status: [Tomamu Dashboard](https://www.snowtomamu.jp/winter/en/ski/ski-slope/condition/)

### ☀️ ASPECT ISSUES
- **Tower Mountain:** Mostly south-facing (sunny = crusty after clear days)
- **Tomamu Mountain:** Southeast aspect (slightly better)
- **Solution:** Hit Tower Mountain trees early AM, or prioritize sidecountry north-facing zones

### 💰 UPSCALE PRICING
- Resort caters to high-end market (families, Club Med, Asian tourists)
- Everything costs more than typical Japanese resort
- Budget accordingly

### 🏢 "RESORT" VIBE (NOT A VILLAGE)
- No traditional Japanese village or town
- Very curated, purpose-built during Japan's bubble era (~$1 billion investment)
- Towering hotels look somewhat out of place
- Limited nightlife (resort bars/restaurants only)
- Zero local izakaya culture
- **Pro:** Modern facilities, English-speaking staff
- **Con:** Lacks authentic Japanese ski town charm

### 🎌 WESTERN CROWD
- Fewer western tourists than Niseko (mostly Asian guests, especially families)
- Club Med brings international crowd but keeps to themselves
- English available but you'll stand out more

### ❄️ EARLY SEASON SNOW
- Not renowned for huge early December volumes (unlike coastal resorts)
- **Our trip is Feb 2 = PRIME SEASON** ✅
- Snowmaking on main trails supplements natural coverage

### 🎿 CABIN FEVER RISK
- If staying multiple days, the "resort bubble" can feel isolating
- **Solution:** We're only here 2 nights (Feb 1-2), plus we'll be skiing all day!
- Ice Village provides evening entertainment
