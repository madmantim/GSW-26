---

## Hot Tips: Powder Stashes & Tree Runs

### Best Tree Zones (Snowboarder-Friendly)
Based on powderhounds.com + off-piste international:

1. **Deep Pine** (off-piste zone #2)
   - Well-spaced pines and evergreens
   - Feeds back to main runs
   - Short hike from Asari lifts

2. **Monkey Park** (off-piste zone #6)
   - Classic Kiroro tree run
   - Medium density, good flow for boards
   - Accessed via Nagamine area

3. **Powder Ridge** (off-piste zone #1)
   - Top elevation powder zone
   - Best after fresh snow
   - Can get tracked fast (Club Med crowds)

### Powder Strategy
- ⚠️ **Fresh tracks disappear FAST** (Club Med + growing popularity)
- Hit trees early AM — crowds stick to groomers first
- Off-piste zones are marked but require navigation skills
- **Hire a guide?** Recommended if we want deep local knowledge (trees/rivers can be tricky)

### Terrain Notes
- **On-piste:** 1/3 beginner, 1/3 intermediate, 1/3 advanced (but not super challenging)
- **Real goods:** Off-piste trees + ungroomed runs
- Mogul courses available (locals love 'em)
- Grand Line = best for cruising/warm-up laps

---

## Best Runs & Areas

### DON'T MISS
- **Asari Peak area** — steeper terrain, better snow
- **Named off-piste zones** (see above)
- **Ungroomed runs** for powder (several blue/black runs left natural)

### SKIPPABLE
- **Family Course** — mellow beginner zone
- **Center Link** — connector run, nothing special

### RECOVERY RUNS
- **Grand Line** — long cruiser, good for tired legs
- **Yoichi Course 1-A** — mellow blue, scenic

---

## Gotchas & Quirks

### ⚠️ WIND CLOSURES
**BIG ISSUE:** Gondola & top lifts close with **moderate wind** (not just extreme)  
- Recent trend at Kiroro (last few years)
- Check lift status morning-of: [Kiroro Dashboard](https://www.kiroro.co.jp/dashboard/)
- Backup plan: Focus on lower lifts if windy

### 💰 UPSCALE PRICING
- Resort caters to high-end market (Club Med clientele)
- Food, rentals, everything costs more than typical Japanese resort
- Budget accordingly

### 🏨 NO VILLAGE
- Resort complex only (Club Med + hotels)
- Limited Japanese culture/local vibe
- Nightlife = resort bars/restaurants only

### 🌨️ FRESH TRACKS COMPETITION
- Club Med + growing popularity = powder gets tracked fast
- Need to be strategic (early AM, off-piste zones, trees)
- Consider guide if we want primo stashes
