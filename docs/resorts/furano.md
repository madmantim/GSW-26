## Terrain & Access Rules

### Off-Piste Policy
✅ **ALLOWED (with discretion)** — Huge upgrade!  
- Official ban **no longer enforced** (as of recent years)
- Be discreet — don't duck ropes in front of patrol
- Extensive sidecountry between Furano Zone and Kitanomine Zone
- **No pass-pulling** if you're sensible about it

### Backcountry Access
- **Gates available** at top of Furano Zone
- Requires proper avalanche gear (beacon, shovel, probe)
- ⚠️ **Not for us** (no ava equipment/training planned)
- Guided tours available to nearby Tokachidake backcountry

### In-Bounds Trees & Sidecountry
- **Link Chair area** = BEST ZONE (between two resort zones)
- Skier's right (Furano Zone): Lines drop into drainage, return via goat-track
- Skier's left: Sheltered gullies (but some exit away from resort — tricky)
- Well-spaced trees, snowboarder-friendly
- Sheltered aspect = powder holds up well after storms

### Premium Zone
- **Steepest run** (34° max, 23° average, 830m long)
- Off-piste area, left ungroomed
- ⚠️ **Not always open** (depends on snowfall/ava conditions)
- Limited avalanche control

---

## Hot Tips: Powder Stashes & Tree Runs

### Best Sidecountry Zones (Snowboarder-Friendly)

1. **Link Chair Area** (PRIORITY #1)
   - Between Furano Zone and Kitanomine Zone
   - Accessible from top of Link Chair OR Furano Gondola
   - Multiple gullies funnel back to lifts (both zones)
   - **Best feature:** Lifts run in low wind (when other resorts shut down)
   - Can lap this zone all day on storm days
   - Short hikes above chair for bonus terrain (but ava-prone — be careful)

2. **Skier's Right (Furano Zone)**
   - Various sustained lines dropping into drainage
   - Return via goat-track along drainage (passes large concrete dam)
   - Longer hike out but quality powder
   - Less tracked than Link Chair area

3. **Premium Zone** (if open)
   - Steepest terrain, left ungroomed
   - Powder paradise after fresh snow
   - Check daily status (often closed)

### Powder Strategy
- ⚠️ **Growing popularity** (Ikon Pass + international visitors)
- Hit sidecountry early AM — crowds stick to groomers first
- Link Chair opens 9am (Furano Ropeway 8:30am)
- Entries/exits can be obscure — takes time to track out
- **Storm day advantage:** Furano's sheltered east aspect keeps lifts running when coastal resorts close (wind-hold)

### Terrain Notes
- **On-piste:** Long, fast groomed runs (former FIS World Cup courses)
- **Real gems:** Sidecountry trees between zones
- East-facing = rain shadow of Mt Furano-Nishi (less snow, more sun)
- Better weather/visibility than coastal resorts like Niseko
- Ungroomed runs left natural for powder

- **Link Chair sidecountry** — prime zone, accessible in all conditions
- **Premium Zone** — if open, this is the steepest/best

- **Skier's right drainage lines** — for committed powder hunters

### SKIPPABLE
- **Beginner Zone** — free area with snow escalators (families only)

## Gotchas & Quirks

### ☀️ LOWER SNOWFALL (Pro/Con)
**Con:** 9m average vs 15m at coastal resorts (Niseko, Rusutsu)  
**Pro:** Drier, lighter powder + more bluebird days  
**Con:** Bad seasons are ROUGH (7-8m = lean pickings)  
**Pro:** East-facing sheltered aspect = great on storm days  

**Bottom line:** Furano excels when others are closed (wind), but can lag in dry spells.

### 🌬️ STORM DAY HERO
- Sheltered east aspect = lifts run in high wind
- When Niseko/Rusutsu are on wind-hold, Furano is lapping powder
- Link Chair + Furano Gondola = low-wind-affected access

### 📈 GROWING CROWDS
- Ikon Pass = more international visitors
- Powder gets tracked faster than it used to
- Still MUCH less crowded than Niseko
- Lift queues sometimes problematic (weekends/holidays)

### 🍜 LIMITED ON-MOUNTAIN FOOD
- "Severely lacking" per Powderhounds review
- Only 4 restaurants for entire resort
- Pack snacks or plan lunch in town

### 🏔️ BASE FOR MULTI-AREA TRIPS
- **Great hub** for day trips: Asahidake, Kamui, Tomamu, Sahoro, Tokachidake
- **Not ideal** if locked into pre-paid packages (we have cars = perfect)

### 🏨 AVOID BIG HOTELS (Not Our Problem)
- Shin Furano Prince Hotel / Furano Prince Hotel = soulless, expensive, off to the side
- Shuttle buses required, captive dining
- **We're not staying there** — just FYI for future reference

## Group-Specific Notes

### Snowboarders
- ✅ Link Chair sidecountry = board-friendly (well-spaced trees)
- ✅ Long groomed runs = excellent for cruising
- ⚠️ Some connector runs can be flat (stay on main routes)
- ✅ Premium Zone (if open) = steep powder paradise

### Morning Session Strategy
- **Goal:** 4-hour powder hit, then drive to Asahikawa
- **Timeline:**
  - 8:30am: First lifts (Furano Ropeway opens 8:30am)
  - 8:30-12:30pm: Lap Link Chair sidecountry + groomers
  - 12:30pm: Depart for Asahikawa
  - Optional: Blue Pond photo stop (+20min)
  - Optional: Fukiage onsen dip (+40min)
  - 2:30-3pm: Arrive Asahikawa, check-in Court Hotel

### Weather Considerations
- Check Premium Zone status morning-of (often closed)
- If windy/stormy: PERFECT (Furano excels on storm days)
- If bluebird: Enjoy those long groomers and tree runs
- Link Chair + Gondola run in most conditions

### Alternative Plan (If Furano Disappoints)
- **We have cars** = can pivot to Asahidake early (1hr drive)
- Furano's lower snowfall means some seasons are lean
- Don't get locked in — flexibility is key
