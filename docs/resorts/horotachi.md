## Terrain & Access Rules

### ⚠️ OFF-PISTE POLICY: FORBIDDEN (Strictly Enforced!)

**This is critical for us:**
- Off-piste skiing **NOT ALLOWED** between courses or in sidecountry
- Staff are known as **"off-piste Nazis"** (Powderhounds' words, not ours!)
- Similar to old-school Furano (pre-2010s)
- **You WILL be reprimanded** if caught in trees
- Visible areas (under chairlift, skier's right of chair) = absolute no-go zones

### The Trees Are Excellent... But

Despite the ban, the tree skiing here is legendary among powder freaks:
- Well-spaced trees with good pitch
- Deep, cold, dry snow (town averages -13°C in winter)
- Gullies and creeks require navigation skills
- Some zones have easy ingress/egress, others are technical

**Our approach:**
- Respect the rules (it's their mountain)
- Stick to the **two ungroomed courses** for powder fun
- The "Powder Line" (Horotachi Course) is steep and legitimate
- If conditions warrant breaking rules, be **invisible** and accept **full self-responsibility**

## Hot Tips: Powder Strategy

### Why Powder Freaks Drive Here

1. **Extreme cold = best snow quality**
   - Horokanai winter avg: -13°C
   - Dec 31, 2020: -32.6°C recorded
   - Record low: -41.2°C (coldest in Japan)
   - Snow is bone-dry, zero moisture

2. **Heavy snowfall**
   - ~13m annual average
   - 2015: 120cm fell in ONE DAY
   - 2018: 326cm max depth recorded
   - Special Heavy Snowfall Designated Area

3. **Low competition**
   - Local town population: 1,500 people
   - Even on powder days, rarely crowded
   - 7-8 people total on spring weekdays (per Mojane report)

### Best Strategy for Feb 11

**Timing:**
- Hit it early if fresh snow overnight
- Low elevation + southeast aspect = sun-affected by afternoon
- If warm temps, snow quality can sour quickly

**Runs to prioritize:**
- **Horotachi Course** (ungroomed powder line) — first!
- **Shirakaba Course** (ungroomed trees) — second priority
- **Karamatsu Course** (groomed but steep) — warm-up/recovery

**Conditions to expect:**
- Late season (Feb 11) may be icy in AM, softening by midday
- Check operating schedule — may only be open Fri-Sun by then
- If sun comes out, snow quality deteriorates fast (low elevation, sunny aspect)

## Best Runs & Areas

### DON'T MISS

**1. Horotachi Course (ほろたちコース)** [ADVANCED]

- Dubbed "Powder Line" by locals
- Gets tracked fast on powder days but uncrowded compared to famous resorts

- Second powder option
- 720m length, 26° max, 17° average
- Ungroomed with trees
- Slightly mellower than Horotachi but still technical
- Visible from parking lot

## Gotchas & Quirks

### ⚠️ LATE SEASON OPERATIONS

**BIG ISSUE for Feb 11:**
- Season typically ends late March
- **From late February onward:** Resort may only open Fri-Sun
- **Operating hours may end earlier than posted**
- **Always call ahead:** 0165-35-3410
- Weather-dependent closures (spring warmth, low snow)

**Our visit is a Wednesday (Feb 11) — MUST CONFIRM IT'S OPEN!**

### 🌡️ LOW ELEVATION + SUNNY ASPECT

- Base: 150m, Top: 367m (very low!)
- Southeast facing = sun exposure
- On warm/sunny days, snow quality deteriorates fast
- Better choice for **brutal weather days** when higher resorts (Asahidake, Kurodake) have wind holds
- Best in **cold, snowy, overcast** conditions

### 🚫 OFF-PISTE ENFORCEMENT

- Already covered above, but worth repeating:
- **Strict patrol** of tree zones
- **No backcountry access** (despite gates/touring potential on Santo-zan nearby)
- Respect the rules or accept consequences

### 🏔️ SMALL SCALE

- 1 chairlift (fixed double, no safety bar)
- 4 courses total
- Won't hold attention for multi-day visit
- **Perfect for a half-day or single-day visit** (which is exactly our plan!)
- Lift blares music and "don't go off-course" announcements (charmingly retro)

### 🏪 NO VILLAGE / LIMITED FACILITIES

- Day lodge only (no resort village)
- Accommodation on-site: **Horotachi Sanso** (basic lodge)
- No rentals, no lessons, no childcare
- Bring everything you need

## Group-Specific Notes

### Snowboarders

✅ **Good news:**
- Horotachi and Shirakaba courses are steep enough for speed
- No significant flat sections on main powder lines
- Tree spacing is good (where accessible)

⚠️ **Challenges:**
- Rinkan course may have flat spots
- Off-piste is forbidden (normally where boards shine)
- Only 1 lift = limited terrain

**Verdict:** Fun for a day, especially if fresh snow. The steep ungroomed runs make it worthwhile.

### Last Ski Day Vibes

**This is our final day on snow! 🎿**
- Small, local, low-key atmosphere = perfect way to wind down
- Less intense than Asahidake/Kurodake
- Enjoy the powder gem without crowds
- Post-ski soba and onsen = cultural sendoff
- Drive back to Nayoro for final onsen dinner at hotel

### Crowd Strategy

- Town population: 1,500 people
- Even powder days are uncrowded
- Feb 11 is a Wednesday — if open, may have resort to ourselves
- Low competition for fresh tracks

### Weather Backup

If Horotachi is closed or conditions are poor:
- **Option 1:** Return to **Nayoro Piyashiri** (skied Feb 10)
- **Option 2:** Drive to **Wassamu** (31km east, 30min)
- **Option 3:** Skip skiing, explore Horokanai soba culture + Lake Shumarinai
