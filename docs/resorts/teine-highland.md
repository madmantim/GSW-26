## Terrain & Access Rules

### Off-Piste Policy
✅ **PERMITTED IN DESIGNATED ZONES**  
- **Nature Zone** (skier's right of Highland quad) — marked off-piste area with ropes
  - Wide tree spacing, relatively mellow pitch
  - Gets tracked quickly (but less than big resorts)
  - Four sets of ropes mark the boundary (they really want you to notice!)
- Standard disclaimers apply: ride at own risk, rescue at own expense
- Patrollers are "incredibly lenient" (per Powderhounds) — not pulling passes

### Backcountry/Sidecountry Gates
🚪 **TEINE GATE** — Legendary backcountry access near summit  
- Gate located near Summit Express top terminal
- No registration required (ride at own risk stance)
- Multiple bowls and chutes accessible
- Can ride down to parking area (long run!)
- ⚠️ **Requires ava gear, experience, and local knowledge**
- ⚠️ **Not for us** — we don't have touring/ava equipment

**Other sidecountry zones:**
- **Under old cable car line** — "rite of passage for expert riders"
  - First to get tracked
  - Visible from resort
- **Skier's left of resort boundary** — multiple bowls, some wide chutes
  - Traversing + side-stepping required
  - Pink ribbons mark return points
  - Nasty cliffs if you go wrong (huck zone for pros only!)
- **Skier's right beyond Nature Zone** — exits to road near gondola
  - Short hike required
  - Less tracked than other zones

### In-Bounds Trees
- **Nature Zone** — best in-bounds tree skiing
  - Beautifully spaced trees (not too tight, not too wide)
  - North facing (powder stays pristine)
  - Consistent fall line
  - Short vertical (legs won't pump out)

---

## Hot Tips: Powder Stashes & Tree Runs

### Best In-Bounds Tree Zones (Snowboarder-Friendly)


**1. Nature Zone** (permitted off-piste, skier's right)
   - **Perfect tree spacing for boards**
   - Wide enough to carve, tight enough to be fun
   - North-facing aspect = cold, dry snow
   - Feeds back to Highland lifts
   - Gets tracked by lunch on powder days (but still good)


**2. Trees under Kitakabe Course**
   - Midway down the "north wall" black run
   - Widely spaced
   - Steep sections (matching the 36° groomed run)
   - Access via Summit Express


**3. Olympic Slalom/GS Courses** (when left ungroomed)
   - Historic runs from 1972 Olympics
   - Technical terrain, good pitch
   - Bumps develop quickly
   - Great for leg burners

### Powder Strategy
- **Arrive EARLY** — 20min from Sapporo = day-trippers arrive fast
- **Hit Nature Zone first** — obvious powder zone gets tracked by 11am
- **Sidecountry = advanced only** — requires traversing skills and terrain knowledge
- **Consider a guide** — local knowledge unlocks the best stashes (gates, pink ribbons, safe lines)
- **Summit views = bonus** — stunning panorama of Sapporo city + Ishikari Bay

### Terrain Notes
- **Highland Zone is the goods** — don't waste time in Olympia (that's beginner zone)
- **Kitakabe Course** — Japan's most iconic steep in-bounds run (36° max pitch)
  - Name literally means "north wall"
  - Develops moguls quickly
  - Half-groomed sometimes
- **Short vertical** — 683m means quick laps, but legs don't get torched
- **Gondola = critical** — connects Olympia ↔ Highland (last one at 3:45pm/4pm)
  - **Miss it = STUCK** (no way back to Highland parking!)

---

## Best Runs & Areas

### DON'T MISS (Highland Zone Only!)
- 🔥 **Kitakabe Course** — 36° steeps, moguls, iconic Japan terrain
- 🌲 **Nature Zone trees** — best in-bounds pow stashes
- 🎿 **Olympic Slalom/GS runs** — historic, technical terrain
- 🏔️ **Summit Express to top** — views + access to steepest terrain

### SKIPPABLE
- ❌ **Entire Olympia Zone** — beginner/family terrain (not for us)
- ❌ **Paradise Lift** — slow double chair, limited terrain access
- ❌ **Connector run Highland → Olympia** — 6km long, flat sections, boring

### RECOVERY RUNS
- **Panorama No.1 & No.2** — moderate pitch, less crowded
- **Green run from summit** — narrow trail, steep for a green (good warm-up)

---

## Gotchas & Quirks

### ⚠️ TWO ZONES = POTENTIAL CONFUSION
**Highland = Expert terrain (GO HERE)**  
**Olympia = Beginner terrain (avoid unless picking up stragglers)**

- Zones connected by gondola + 6km flat connector run
- Park at **Highland** if you want steep/powder
- If anyone ends up in Olympia by mistake, gondola is the only realistic return

### 🚡 OLD LIFTS = SLOW LAPS
- Paradise, Panorama No.1, No.2 = ancient double chairs
- Summit Express (hooded quad) is fast — stick to this
- Old Olympic cable car = retired (was an "institution" but needed to go)

### 📏 SHORT VERTICAL
- 683m = quick runs (great for powder laps, but not a leg-burner resort)
- Sidecountry can extend the descent significantly (if you traverse out)

### 🌫️ FOG POTENTIAL
- Coastal location = fog possible
- Entire resort below treeline (visibility still OK in trees)

### 🚌 DAY-TRIPPER CENTRAL
- 40min from Sapporo = busy on weekends/holidays
- Weekday = quieter (Jan 29 = Thursday, should be good!)
- Powder gets tracked faster than remote resorts

### 🎿 1972 OLYMPICS NOSTALGIA
- Olympic Torch still stands at summit
- Bobsled reminders in Olympia area
- Old cable car towers = photo op (kooky rocket ship towers)

## Group-Specific Notes

### Snowboarders (Entire Crew!)
- ✅ **Nature Zone = ideal tree spacing** for boards
- ✅ **Steep terrain = rare for Hokkaido** (usually more mellow)
- ✅ **No major flat sections** in Highland (avoid Olympia entirely!)
- ✅ **Gondola = hooded** (board-friendly, no sketchy T-bars)
- ⚠️ **Sidecountry traversing** = may require unhooking (locals know best lines)

### First Day Strategy
**This is Day 1 of skiing — be smart:**
- Don't blow legs out immediately (short vertical = manageable)
- Warm up on Panorama runs, progress to Kitakabe steeps
- Test gear, get ski legs back
- Nature Zone trees = good confidence builder
- Save energy for 16 more days of skiing!

### Timing Considerations
- **Dinner reservation:** Tall Sun Dining Izakaya at 18:30 (see itinerary)
- **Onsen option:** Teine Onsen Honoka (5min away) = perfect post-ski, pre-dinner
- **Drive back:** 40-45min to hotel (need to leave by ~5:30pm for relaxed schedule)
- **Realistic ski day:** 9am first lift → 3:30pm last run = 6.5 hours (plenty!)

### Weather Considerations
- **Check forecast morning-of** — coastal weather can change
- **Fog backup plan:** Stick to trees (Nature Zone, under Kitakabe)
- **Wind closures:** Less common than higher elevation resorts (below treeline)

### Photo Opportunities
- 📸 Summit panorama (Sapporo city + Ishikari Bay + Sea of Japan)
- 📸 Old Olympic cable car towers (kooky retro vibes)
- 📸 Olympic Torch monument
- 📸 Steep Kitakabe descent (if someone can shoot from below!)
