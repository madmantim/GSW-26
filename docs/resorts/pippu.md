## Hot Tips: Powder Stashes & Tree Runs

### Why Pippu is Perfect for Tired Legs
1. **Usually empty** — often feels like a private resort
2. **Short, manageable laps** — not exhausting
3. **Mellow off-piste** — no commitment required
4. **Super cheap** — won't feel guilty leaving early
5. **Onsen next door** — soak those legs!

### Best Tree Zones (Snowboarder-Friendly)
- **Skier's left trees** (off Deep Snow Course / Golden Course)
  - Well-spaced pines
  - Easy entry/exit
  - Perfect practice zone for tree riding
  - Small zones = low commitment

### Powder Strategy
- ✅ **Fresh tracks last LONGER** here (low crowds)
- Hit trees in morning if there's fresh snow
- School groups usually stick to Family/Strawberry courses (right side)
- Defense force training groups = hilarious to watch (old white skis!)

### Terrain Notes
- **On-piste:** 30% beginner, 50% intermediate, 20% advanced
- **Real goods:** Off-piste trees + Deep Snow Course
- **Longest run:** Strawberry Course (2,200m) — mellow cruiser
- **Best for recovery:** Family Course (2,000m, 13° average) or Diamond Course

## Best Runs & Areas

### DON'T MISS
- **Deep Snow Course** — if legs permit, this is the most fun on-piste
- **Skier's left trees** — perfect for mellow powder practice
- **Strawberry Course** — longest run (2,200m), great warm-up

### PERFECT FOR RECOVERY
- **Family Course** — 2,000m, 13° average, super mellow
- **Diamond Course** — 1,500m, 16° average, "for people who just can't stop skiing"
- **Silver Course** — 700m, smooth intermediate cruiser

### SKIPPABLE
- **Beginner Course** — very short (400m), 8° — only for absolute beginners
- **Kappa Course** — 600m, basically a bunny hill ("mini skiers' home ground")

### LAPS FOR THE KEEN

## Gotchas & Quirks

### 🏫 SCHOOL GROUPS
- Weekdays can see busloads of school kids
- They swarm the beginner/family areas (right side of mountain)
- Usually gone by early afternoon
- **We're skiing Sunday** — should be quieter

### 🎖️ DEFENSE FORCE TRAINING
- Occasionally see Japanese Self-Defense Force doing ski training
- Hilariously old-school white skis
- Usually polite and stick to their own area
- Makes for great photos/stories

### ⛷️ SMALL RESORT = LIMITED TERRAIN
- You'll ski everything in 2-3 hours
- Not a destination resort
- **That's the point** — perfect recovery day
- If you want more, sidecountry is there

### 🌡️ LOW ELEVATION = VARIABLE SNOW
- 250-580m elevation (very low by Hokkaido standards)
- SW facing aspect (sun can affect snow)
- **BUT:** Interior location + frigid temps = usually good quality
- Fresh snow is best (tracks out slower here anyway)

### 🏗️ AGING INFRASTRUCTURE
- Yellow single chair is no longer operational
- Resort is shrinking (like many small Japanese resorts)
- What remains is well-maintained but basic

### 🔇 EXTREMELY QUIET
- Often feels deserted (unless school groups visit)
- Don't expect lively atmosphere
- **Perfect for tired legs** — no pressure to "keep up"
