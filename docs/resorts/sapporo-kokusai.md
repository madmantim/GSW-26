## Terrain & Access Rules

### Off-Piste Policy
✅ **ALLOWED but officially prohibited** — This is key for us!  
- Off-piste is technically prohibited BUT not policed
- No patrollers chasing you with whistles
- Locals ride off-piste all the time
- Far less enforcement than most Japanese resorts

**Translation:** You're good to go. Just be smart about it.

### Backcountry Access
✅ **EXCELLENT ACCESS** — One of the best resort-accessed BC zones in Hokkaido  
- Gondola top station (1,100m) provides easy access to:
  - **Mt. Asari** (1,281m) — classic tour, ~200m elevation gain
  - **Mt. Shirai** — longer tour with tree runs
- Well-known backcountry touring destination since the 1910s
- Intermediate-level tours with spectacular tree runs

⚠️ **Not for us without a guide** (no touring gear/ava equipment planned)  
But good to know the terrain is legendary if we wanted to hire a guide!

### In-Bounds Trees
✅ **SNOWBOARDER HEAVEN**  
- Generously spaced trees throughout the resort
- Park-like gladed zones with excellent spacing
- Multiple powder stashes in tree zones
- "Deep not steep" terrain philosophy
- Plenty of pitch if you can read terrain well

---

## Hot Tips: Powder Stashes & Tree Runs

### Best Tree Zones (Snowboarder-Friendly)
Based on NinjaPowder, Powderhounds, and Whiteroom guides:

- **In-Bounds Tree Pockets**
    - Scattered throughout the resort (skier's left side especially)
    - Generously spaced — perfect for boards
    - "Farm skiing" strategy: push out to sides, ski fresh all day
    - Less tracked than groomers (crowds stick to pistes)

- **Gullies & Natural Features**
    - Band of R-rated cliffs (avoid unless confident)
    - Multiple gullies to explore
    - Snow protected from wind = consistently good conditions
    - North-facing zones hold powder longest

- **Backcountry Tree Runs** (with guide only)
    - Mt. Shirai → Mt. Asari route = "park-like gullies"
    - 20-30 min run through ancient trees
    - Enormous old-growth trees
    - Feeds back to resort

### Powder Strategy
- ⚠️ **WEEKEND CROWDS** — This is a local favorite from Sapporo/Otaru
- **Weekday visit = perfect** (we're going Friday, borderline)
- Hit tree zones early — crowds stick to groomers first
- "Farm skiing" approach: work the sides all day for fresh lines
- Off-piste areas are quieter than pistes

### Terrain Notes
- **Official terrain:** 30% beginner, 50% intermediate, 20% advanced
- **Reality:** The goods are off-piste
- Only 1 black run on trail map (would be blue with grooming)
- Moguls on black run add spice
- Maximum gradient: 30 degrees (on powder slopes)
- "Deep not steep" philosophy = perfect for powder surfing

---

## Best Runs & Areas

### DON'T MISS
- **Tree pockets skier's left** — best powder stashes
- **Natural gullies** — protected snow, consistent quality
- **Off-piste zones** — officially prohibited, actually amazing
- **Views from gondola top** — Japanese Sea, Otaru Bay, Ishikari Bay on clear days

### SKIPPABLE
- **Groomed beginner zones** — we're not here for this
- **Terrain park** — good for beginners/intermediates but not our focus

### RECOVERY RUNS
- **Wide mellow runs (skier's right)** — when legs are tired
- **Groomed reds** — limited but pleasant for warm-up laps
