## Terrain & Access Rules

### ⚠️ THIS IS NOT A SKI RESORT — IT'S BACKCOUNTRY

**Critical:** Asahidake is **unpatrolled, uncontrolled backcountry** with ropeway access  
- No ski patrol
- No avalanche control
- No marked runs (4 groomed cat tracks are just exit routes)
- Trail maps have warnings: rescue off-piste at your own cost
- **MUST carry beacon, shovel, probe**

### Off-Piste Policy
✅ **ALLOWED** — but you're on your own  
- Essentially the entire mountain is off-piste
- Treat as backcountry: assess snow stability, plan routes, manage risks
- Active volcano = heavy snow loads on warm ground = increased ava risk
- Fumaroles (volcanic vents) in alpine zone can be hazardous

### In-Bounds Trees
🌲 **Beautiful tree skiing**  
- Well-spaced trees in lower 2/3 of ropeway zone
- Pick any line you fancy once into the trees
- Some zones require route-finding (creek crossings, terrain traps)
- Snowboarder-friendly spacing **BUT...**

### ⚠️ SNOWBOARDER CHALLENGES
- Bottom third gets flat — exit via groomed cat tracks (can be tedious)
- Many sidecountry lines don't run fall-line → shuffling/poling required
- Creek crossing 2/3 down forces you back to groomed trails
- Serious flat zones if you pick wrong line
- **Consider hiring a guide** if you want to maximize terrain (minimize flat suffering)

## Hot Tips: Powder Stashes & Tree Runs

### Powder Strategy

**1. Hit early AM** — freshies disappear fast near ropeway top

**2. Fan out wider** — fresh tracks available at lunch if you're willing to hike a bit

**3. Short hikes = big rewards** — sidecountry has steeper pitches, less tracked

**4. Alpine touring** — endless terrain above ropeway (skin/snowshoe required)

### Best Zones (Ropeway Accessed)

**TOP SECTION (Alpine & Upper Trees)**
- Reasonably open with short steep pitches
- Some natural hits (rocks, small cliffs, mushrooms)
- Gets tracked quickly but refills often with ~14m/year snowfall
- Skier's left has nice steep bowls (short hike required)

**MID SECTION (Trees)**
- Well-spaced pines and evergreens
- Pick your line — all routes lead down
- **Best powder:** Protected from wind, stays light and fluffy
- Beautiful tree skiing for advanced riders

**LOWER SECTION**
- Terrain flattens out
- Creek crossing forces exit via groomed trails
- Groundhog Day feeling (same exit runs repeatedly)

### Sidecountry (Short Hikes)
- Hike up/out from ropeway top for steeper pitches
- **Skier's left:** Short hikes access nice bowls
- **Skier's right:** Various lines but many flatten out or end at river (dead ends)
- Route-finding essential — easy to end up in closed valleys requiring trudging

### Alpine Terrain (Skin/Snowshoe)
- **Massive expanse** above ropeway
- Steep bowls, expert lines
- **Weather dependent:** Visibility often poor, snow can be wind-scoured
- **Hazards:** Fumaroles (stinky volcanic vents), cracks, poor visibility
- **Recommended:** Hire a guide for alpine touring

---

## Best Runs & Areas

### DON'T MISS
- **Tree skiing** — lower 2/3 of ropeway zone (the real goods!)
- **Short hike zones** — sidecountry above ropeway top
- **Powder laps** — anywhere in trees after fresh snow
- **Alpine bowls** — if you're touring/have a guide

### SKIPPABLE
- **Groomed cat tracks** — boring! (Only use for exit)
- **Flat zones** — unavoidable on exit, but not the point

### RECOVERY RUNS
- **Groomed trails** — mellow cat tracks for when you're tired
- This is NOT a recovery mountain — go elsewhere for cruising

## On-Mountain Food

### LUNCH (Ropeway Building Only)

**Cafeteria** (Ropeway Base Building)
- Inexpensive, basic ski cafeteria food
- Noodles, curry rice, typical Japanese ski food
- Nothing fancy but gets the job done
- **Pro tip:** Pork buns from kiosk while waiting for ropeway!

**Food Kiosk**
- Snacks, drinks, pork buns
- Limited selection

**THAT'S IT.** No other on-mountain dining options.

### Alternative: Asahidake Onsen Hotels
- Several hotels in tiny village below ropeway
- Can visit hotel restaurants for lunch (walk down from ropeway)
- Better food but costs time/skiing

## Gotchas & Quirks

### ⚠️ WEATHER-DEPENDENT OPERATION
**BIGGEST ISSUE:** Ropeway closes frequently due to high winds  
- Even moderate winds can shut it down
- Check operation status morning-of (website has current conditions)
- **Backup plan essential** — consider Kurodake (other side of mountain) or bail to another resort

### ❄️ WEATHER CAN BE BRUTAL
- Often poor visibility during peak winter
- Temperatures can hit **-27°C** (we're not kidding!)
- Heavy snowfall = whiteout conditions
- Wind-scoured snow in alpine zone
- **BUT:** This is when the powder is best!

### 🐌 LOW VERTICAL OUTPUT
- Only 500m per lap
- Ropeway every 20min = ~10 runs/day max (without skinning)
- Relatively leisurely day compared to lift-serviced resorts
- **This is backcountry pace** — quality over quantity

### 🎿 WALK TO SKI
- Ropeway built for hikers, not skiers
- Must walk uphill from top station before you can drop in
- Annoying but minor

### 🏔️ ACTIVE VOLCANO
- Fumaroles emit steam and sulfurous gas (stinky!)
- Some cracks/hazards in alpine zone
- Generally safe but adds to backcountry hazards

### 🚫 NO AMENITIES
- No rental shop (bring your own gear or rent in Asahikawa)
- No terrain park, no pipe
- Tiny village (Asahidake Onsen) = very limited nightlife/restaurants
- National park = minimal development

### 🏂 SNOWBOARDERS: MANAGE EXPECTATIONS
- Trees are great
- Flat exits are tedious
- Sidecountry has flat traps
- **Strong recommendation:** Hire a guide to maximize good terrain and avoid flat suffering

## Group-Specific Notes

### 🏂 Snowboarders: Real Talk
This mountain will **test your patience** on the flats, but **reward you** in the trees.

**Pros:**
- Tree spacing is perfect for boards
- Powder is world-class (dry, deep, cold)
- Minimal crowds = fresh tracks
- Natural hits everywhere

**Cons:**
- Flat exit runs are tedious (will test your shuffle game)
- Sidecountry has flat traps if you pick wrong line
- Only 500m vertical per lap

**Recommendation:**
- **Hire a guide** for first runs — they'll show you lines that minimize flats
- Bring poles for shuffling
- Manage expectations: this is backcountry, not a resort
- If you hate flats, consider skipping and skiing Kamui instead

### 🎿 Advanced/Expert Skiers
**You will love this place.**  
- Endless terrain if you're willing to skin
- Tree skiing is sublime
- Powder quality is as good as it gets
- Hire a guide to unlock alpine zones

### 🎒 Gear Checklist
**MUST BRING:**
- Beacon, shovel, probe (non-negotiable)
- Fat powder skis/board
- Warm layers (temps can hit -27°C)
- Goggles (visibility often poor)
- Poles for snowboarders (seriously!)
- Water/snacks (limited on-mountain options)

**Optional but recommended:**
- Splitboard or touring setup (if you want alpine zones)
- Face mask/balaclava (it's COLD)
- Extra batteries (cold kills them fast)

### 📅 Day Plan
**07:30** — Depart Court Hotel Asahikawa  
**08:40** — Arrive Asahidake Ropeway, gear up  
**09:00** — First ropeway up  
**09:00-15:00** — Powder laps (expect ~8-10 runs)  
**15:00** — Last runs down  
**15:30** — Onsen soak at Asahidake Onsen hotel (optional)  
**16:30** — Depart for Asahikawa  
**17:40** — Back in Asahikawa  
**18:30** — Dinner at Tenkin

### ☁️ Backup Plans
If ropeway is closed due to wind:

**1. Kurodake** (Sounkyo side) — different ropeway, might be running

**2. Kamui Ski Links** — closer to Asahikawa, more lift-serviced

**3. Bail to Asahikawa** — rest day, explore sake brewery/zoo/city

### 🥶 Weather Reality Check
**Feb 5 is PEAK WINTER.** Expect:
- Temperatures: -15°C to -25°C
- Heavy snowfall possible
- Whiteout conditions possible
- Wind closures possible

**This is HARDCORE skiing.** Not a cruise day. Dress warm, stay safe, enjoy the best powder on Earth.
