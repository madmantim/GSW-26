## Terrain & Access Rules

- **4 named ungroomed tree zones** (official resort areas):
  - **Shinsetsu** (fresh snow zone)
  - **Tree Run A**
  - **Tree Run B**
  - **Tree Run C**
- Resort encourages tree skiing within controlled areas
- These zones are ungroomed and subject to closure in poor weather/snow conditions

### Sidecountry/Backcountry
⚠️ **PROHIBITED** without permission  
- Must obtain permission from Kamikawa Regional Forestry Office
- **OR** use licensed local guide company (easier option)
- Resort not responsible for out-of-bounds accidents
- You'll pay all rescue costs if you go OB without permission

### In-Bounds Trees
- Four official tree zones (see above)
- Well-spaced trees, snowboarder-friendly
- Easy to get lost — hiring a guide recommended for deep exploration
- **Kamui International School** available for guiding/lessons

## Hot Tips: Powder Stashes & Tree Runs

### Why Kamui is Special
**"The all-you-can-eat powder buffet"** — Kamui means "god" or "divine being" in Ainu mythology, and this place lives up to the name!

### Best Tree Zones (Snowboarder-Friendly)
- **Official Tree Runs (A, B, C)**
    - Well-spaced pines and evergreens
    - Good flow for boards
    - Less tracked than famous resorts
    - Named zones feed back to lifts

- **Shinsetsu Zone**
    - Ungroomed fresh snow area
    - Top elevation powder stashes
    - Check conditions daily (can close in bad weather)

### Powder Strategy
- ✅ **HUGE ADVANTAGE:** Uncrowded compared to Niseko/Kiroro
- ✅ Fresh tracks last MUCH longer here
- ✅ Weekdays are borderline empty (away from groomers)
- ⚠️ Weekends = school groups on groomed runs (but trees stay quiet)
- ⚠️ Gondola can have queues on weekends
- **Pro tip:** Hit trees early, but don't stress — this isn't a race like at Kiroro

### Snow Quality
- Less snowfall than coastal resorts (8m vs 15-21m)
- **BUT:** Often BETTER quality due to colder temps and Central Hokkaido location
- "Up there as some of the best in the world" — Powderhounds review
- Excellent blue sky days (Hokkaido sunshine!)

### Navigation Notes
- Easy to get lost in sidecountry (lots of traversing to return)
- **Snowboarders beware:** Some sidecountry requires flat traverses
- Consider hiring **Kamui International School** guide for local beta

## Best Runs & Areas

### DON'T MISS
- **Tree Run zones A, B, C** — where the magic happens
- **Shinsetsu zone** — ungroomed powder paradise
- **Off-piste exploration** — relaxed policy means freedom

### SKIPPABLE
- **Groomed beginner runs** — fine, but not why we're here
- **School group zones** — can be busy on weekends

### RECOVERY RUNS
- **Groomed intermediate runs** (40% of terrain)
- Good variety of mellow blues for tired legs

### Terrain Breakdown
- 40% beginner
- 40% intermediate  
- 20% advanced

**Reality:** The stats don't tell the story — the real goods are in the trees and off-piste zones!

## Gotchas & Quirks

### 💰 BUDGET PARADISE
- **This is the anti-Kiroro:** Cheap passes, cheap food, no pretense

### 🚡 OLD LIFTS
- 1 gondola + 5 double chairs

- Typical of smaller Japanese resorts
- **But:** Less time on lifts = more powder for us!

### 🧭 NAVIGATION

- Flat traverses required to return (snowboarders note!)
- Guide recommended for deep exploration

### 🌨️ WEATHER
- Tree runs subject to closure in poor conditions
- Check daily report: [Kamui Daily Status](https://www.kamui-skilinks.com/wp/today/) (updated 7:30am)
