## Hot Tips: Powder Stashes & Tree Runs

### THE WASSAMU SECRET 🤫
**This is the dream:** Opens at **10am** (leisurely!) and powder **stays untouched until late in the day**. Zero crowds. Zero competition. If you've been dealing with tracked-out resorts, this is your therapy day.

### Powder Strategy
- **No rush!** — Seriously. Sleep in. The powder will wait.
- **Hit the trees mid-morning** — Still untracked at 11am, noon, even 2pm
- **Lap the ungroomed zones** (marked red on map) — Locals might not even touch them
- **Single chair = goods** — Top lift accesses the best tree zones
- **Explore both sides** — Skier's right has more vertical, left is quicker laps

### Terrain Notes
- **Max gradient 30°** — Not scary steep, but pitchy enough to be fun
- **Trees are well-spaced** — Great for snowboards (no tight squeeze)
- **Small creeks/gullies** — Pay attention, especially in low snow
- **Canal near base** — Easy to spot and avoid
- **Cross-country tracks at base** — If anyone's feeling XC vibes

### What Makes This Special
- **Town-run operation** — No corporate vibe, pure local ski hill
- **Powder persistence** — Because it's so unknown, fresh tracks last ALL DAY
- **Sunny aspect + low elevation** — Perfect for cold days (which are common in Dohoku in Feb)
- **Training ground for Olympians** — Yuka Takeuchi (Sochi 2014 silver medalist) trained here!

## Best Runs & Areas

### DON'T MISS
- **Single chair tree zones** (both sides) — The real reason you're here
- **Ungroomed red courses** — Powder playgrounds
- **Top-to-bottom runs** (~1km) — Short but sweet

### SKIPPABLE
- Nothing really — it's all good for a small hill
- Beginner trails if you want pitch

### RECOVERY RUNS
- **Groomed courses from pair lift** — Mellow, wide, perfect for warm-up
- **Periphery beginner trails** — Easy cruise, scenic views

## Gotchas & Quirks

### ⏰ LATE OPENING (10AM)
- Not a 9am resort — embrace the slow morning
- Check their Twitter/Facebook for daily status
- **Inconsistent lift operations** — Sometimes only 1 lift runs
- Weather/staffing can affect which lifts operate

### 📅 RACE SCHEDULE (2025-26)
Check the official site — multiple weekends have alpine ski races:
- **Feb 21 (Sat)** — Giant Slalom race (Courses A+B closed until ~12:30pm)
- **Mar 7 (Sat)** — Town ski race (Course B only, until ~11:30am)
- **Mar 20 (Fri)** — Provincial junior alpine race (Courses A+B, until ~12:30pm)

**Feb 9 = CLEAR!** No races scheduled on our day.

### ☀️ SUNNY ASPECT
- Southwest-facing slopes
- Great when it's cold (which it will be in Northern Hokkaido in Feb)
- Can get sun-affected if temps rise (rare in Feb)

### 🌡️ LOW ELEVATION (154-347m)
- Watch the forecast — needs cold temps for good snow quality
- If forecast is warm (above 0°C), consider alternatives
- Usually not an issue in February

### 🏔️ SMALL TERRAIN
- Only ~200m vertical — you'll lap this quickly
- Don't expect variety like Niseko or Furano
- Think of it as a powder buffet, not a resort tour

### 🚑 LIMITED RESOURCES
- Town-run, small staff
- No major rescue/patrol infrastructure
- If you venture into sidecountry, you're on your own
- **Stay smart, stay visible, stay together**

## Nearby Attractions (On Travel Path)

### Route Context
We're traveling **Asahikawa → Wassamu → Nayoro** along **Route 40** (the main north-south artery of Hokkaido). This is a rural, agricultural region — expect farmland, small towns, and local character.

### 🏔️ Horokanai Sanmen-yama (Backcountry Peak)
**Distance:** ~20km north of Wassamu (toward Nayoro)  
**Location:** Just south of Wassamu Pass  
**Why visit:** Famous backcountry ski touring peak (547m)  
**Description:** Perfect triangular pyramid with south, northwest, and northeast slopes. Known for "cold powder snow that Horokanai is famous for."  
**For us?** ❌ Not equipped (no touring gear, avalanche equipment)  
**Worth knowing:** Shows the quality of snow in this region!

### 🍜 Wassamu Town Center
**Distance:** Walking distance from ski area  
**What's there:** Small rural town, convenience stores, local restaurants  
**Vibe:** Authentic Hokkaido farm town (famous for pumpkins and cabbage!)  
**Quick stop:** Grab onigiri or snacks for the road

### 🚂 Wassamu Station (JR Soya Main Line)
**Location:** Visible from Route 40  
**Why mention it:** Historic station on the line to Wakkanai (northernmost city in Japan)  
**Photo op:** Classic Hokkaido rural station if you're into rail culture

### 🛁 Nayoro Onsen Sunpillar (Our Destination!)
**Distance:** ~45km north (~40min drive)  
**Why visit:** This is where we're staying! Dinner included.  
**Vibe:** Traditional Japanese onsen hotel in the deep north  
**Note:** After a day of powder laps at Wassamu, hot springs and a kaiseki dinner = perfection

### 🌸 Shiokari Pass (塩狩峠)
**Distance:** ~10km north of Wassamu (on Route 40)  
**Why mention it:** Famous cherry blossom spot (1,600 trees), setting of a classic Japanese novel  
**For us:** Winter = no cherry blossoms, but scenic drive through the pass

### 🍶 Local Sake & Breweries
**Reality check:** This is rural farmland — no major breweries/distilleries on this route  
**Nearest sake:** Asahikawa (where we're coming from) has several sake breweries  
**Alternative:** Stock up in Asahikawa before departing, or wait for Nayoro

## Group-Specific Notes

### Snowboarders
- ✅ **IDEAL for boards** — Trees well-spaced, no tight squeeze
- ✅ No flats in tree zones (good pitch, natural fall line)
- ✅ Pair lift runs at decent speed (not painfully slow)
- ✅ No rope tows or T-bars (all chairlifts)

### Powder Day Strategy
- **Sleep in!** (Opens 10am, powder waits until 2pm)
- Spend 3-4 hours here (10am-2pm)
- Drive to Nayoro (2pm-3pm)
- Arrive at onsen for check-in, soak, dinner

### Why This Day Works
**It's a palate cleanser:**
- After Kamui (big) and Pippu (bigger), this is intimate and local
- Zero pressure, zero crowds, zero competition
- Everyone gets fresh tracks all day
- Cheap as chips (¥2,000!)
- Short drive to Nayoro onsen (not a marathon travel day)

### Alternative Plan (If Conditions Are Bad)
- Wassamu is low elevation — if forecast is warm or rainy, pivot to:
  - **Extra day at Kamui Ski Links** (bigger, higher, more options)
  - **Drive straight to Nayoro** (arrive early, explore town, onsen time)

### Night Skiing Option
- If we're having TOO much fun and don't want to leave:
  - Night skiing ¥500 (5pm-8pm)
  - Pair lift has lights
  - Drive to Nayoro after (arrive ~9pm, late onsen soak)
  - ⚠️ Might miss included dinner at Sunpillar (confirm timing)
