## Terrain & Access Rules

### Off-Piste Policy
⚠️ **OFFICIALLY NOT PERMITTED** — but enforcement is relaxed  
- Powderhounds reports: "Ski patrol don't seem too fussed about it"
- Japow Travel: "Roped and off-piste zones are enforced" (no gate network)
- **Reality check:** Casual in-bounds tree runs appear tolerated, but ducking ropes = pass pull risk
- **Our approach:** Stick to visible tree zones within marked boundaries, don't push boundaries

### In-Bounds Tree Skiing
- ✅ Trees throughout the resort (below treeline skiing)
- Well-spaced evergreens and pines
- Multiple glades and soft-shoulder features within marked terrain
- "Little gullies that fill like bowls, micro-spines that collect cold smoke"

### Terrain Breakdown
- **Marked runs:** 21 courses (8 beginner, 3 intermediate, 10 advanced)
- **Reality:** Advanced runs aren't super challenging (max 39° pitch, but momentary)
- **True difficulty:** Depends on moguls and stumps poking through
- **Best terrain:** Off-piste tree runs for advanced riders

## Hot Tips: Powder Stashes & Tree Runs

### Powder Strategy
✅ **THE BIG WIN:** Low crowds = powder longevity  
- Weekdays feel like private sessions
- Fresh tracks often last past lunch (even on weekends)
- Most skiers/boarders stick to groomers → trees stay fresh

### Best Tree Zones (Snowboarder-Friendly)
Based on Japow Travel + Powderhounds:

- **Upper Mountain Tree Runs**
    - Access via gondola → high quads
    - Best pitch and fall line
    - Work the fall-line shots early before obvious lines get trenched
    - Even when tracked, dry snow "smears and slarves beautifully"

- **Lee-Side Glades** (storm days)
    - Hit protected sides first when wind is up
    - Trees hold snow well despite exposed ridgeline
    - Creep toward exposed spines as wind eases

- **Connector Glades**
    - Secret stash fringes between main runs
    - "Pop back to main piste without grinding cat tracks"
    - Locals ignore these → good for afternoon sessions

### Terrain Notes (Snowboarder-Specific)
- ✅ Well-spaced trees (good for boards)
- ✅ Long groomers with good fall line
- ⚠️ Some connector runs can be flat (typical Japan issue)
- ✅ No crazy traverses to best zones
- ✅ "Hero-snow carving clinics" on top-to-bottom groomers

---

## Best Runs & Areas

### DON'T MISS
- **Gondola → High Quad laps** — best vertical, best pitch
- **Tree zones on upper mountain** — fall-line shots, dry powder
- **Top-to-bottom groomer runs** — "chalk-dry carving clinics" (first chair!)
- **Sahoro Express quad area** — services black runs, NNE aspect (holds snow well)

### GOOD FOR RECOVERY
- **Mid-mountain sheltered trails** — when visibility tanks
- **Beginner trails** — long, gentle, scenic
- **New "Beginners Park" area** — snow escalators, mellow terrain (skip unless teaching someone)

### SKIPPABLE
- **Sahoro Express quad** — doesn't always operate (frustrating!)
- **Top lift** — "almost never operates" (plan on gondola laps for full vertical)
- **Night skiing** — mellow carving only, not powder hunting (ends 18:00)

## Gotchas & Quirks

### ⚠️ LIFT CLOSURES
**FRUSTRATING:** Sahoro Express & top lift often don't run  
- "Frustrating to figure out which lifts might actually have running on any given day"
- Top lift "almost never operates"
- Forces gondola laps for full vertical (can get repetitive)
- Check lift status at gondola station before committing to zones

### 🌬️ WIND & WEATHER
- **Ridge can scour:** Wind affects top mountain
- **Trees hold well:** Protected zones preserve quality
- **Tokachi side weather:** Colder and clearer post-storm (less maritime moisture)
- **Sunny days common:** East/southeast slopes can sun-affect (hit shaded sides first)

### 🏔️ LOWER SNOWFALL
- ~8m annual (vs. 15-21m at Niseko/Kiroro)
- **Trade-off:** Drier, feathery snow quality ("chalky and dry")
- More southerly storm dependency (less frequent than NW storms)
- Early season can be thin (we're visiting Feb 3 = mid-season, should be good)

### 🏨 NO VILLAGE
- Resort complex only (Club Med + Sahoro Resort Hotel)
- Minimal nightlife (hotel bars/restaurants only)
- Shintoku town nearby (~15-20min taxi) but basic
- **Our situation:** Not an issue since we're staying at Tomamu (just day tripping)

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 SCHOOL GROUPS
- Gondola queues can happen due to school kids
- Weekday visits = less of an issue
- Hit early for first chair advantage

## Nearby Attractions (On Travel Path)

### 🛁 Tokachigawa Onsen
**Distance:** ~50km east of Sahoro (towards Obihiro)  
**Type:** Famous "moor onsen" (plant-based hot spring — rare!)  
**Why visit:** Unique amber-colored water, skin-beautifying properties  
**Time needed:** 1-2 hours  
**Route:** If heading toward Obihiro/Tokachi region (not on our route to Furano)

### 🛁 Fukiage Open-Air Onsen
**Distance:** ~40km northwest (near Kamifurano)  
**Rating:** 4.5★  
**Type:** FREE wild onsen in the mountains  
**Why visit:** Mixed bathing, natural setting, adventure experience  
**Note:** On route toward Furano (our next day) — good post-ski stop  
**Caution:** Very rustic, no facilities, mixed gender

### 🏔️ Shintoku Town
**Distance:** 15-20min taxi from resort  
**Highlights:**  
- **Soba noodles** — Tokachi region specialty
- Local restaurants (basic but authentic)
- Convenience stores for supplies
- Escape the resort bubble

### 🎿 Combine with Tomamu
**Distance:** 32km (30-40min)  
**Strategy:** Since we're based at Tomamu, could split the group:
- Half-day Sahoro → afternoon at Tomamu
- Or full day Sahoro, evening at Tomamu facilities
- Tomamu has better dining/nightlife options

## Group-Specific Notes

### Snowboarders
- ✅ Tree spacing is excellent for boards
- ✅ Good fall-line on groomers
- ✅ No extreme traverses to best zones
- ⚠️ Some flat connector runs (standard Japan)
- ✅ Uncrowded = confidence-building terrain

### Why Sahoro for This Day?
- **Close to base:** Only 30-40min from Tomamu (easy morning, relaxed pace)
- **Good variety:** Mix of groomers and trees
- **Low crowds:** Weekday in early Feb = likely quiet
- **Recovery-friendly:** Not as intense as Asahidake/Kurodake later in trip
- **Intermediate heaven:** Great for mixed-ability group

### Strategy for the Day
- **Early start:** First gondola for best tree runs
- **Morning:** Hit upper mountain trees while fresh
- **Lunch:** Fomalhaut (ramen/curry)
- **Afternoon:** Groomers or explore connector glades
- **Evening:** Return to Tomamu for dinner at Camaro Steak Diner (18:30 booking)

### Weather/Conditions Backup
- If Sahoro is windy/poor visibility → stick to Tomamu instead (we're based there)
- If amazing powder → hit Sahoro hard (low crowds = fresh tracks all day)
- If mixed group energy → split day between both resorts

## Resort Philosophy

**From Japow Travel:**
> "Sahoro isn't a headline hog — it's the steady friend who shows up with cold, consistent snow, room to move, and a calm atmosphere that lets you ski more and stress less. If your Japow mission values quality turns, low crowds, and clear-sky windows between resets, Sahoro delivers — especially midweek."

**Perfect for us because:**
- Mid-trip day (Feb 3 = Day 6)
- Relaxed vibe after Tomamu
- Day before Furano (which can be busier)
- Snowboarder-friendly terrain
- Close to base (low travel stress)
