## Hot Tips: Powder Stashes & Tree Runs

### The Piyashiri Advantage
🌨️ **"SILKY SNOW"** — Resort claims best snow quality in Hokkaido  
- Temperature regularly drops to **-20°C to -30°C** in early Feb
- Creates ultra-light, dry powder (even lighter than typical Hokkaido powder!)
- Low humidity + extreme cold = "silky snow" phenomenon
- **Diamond dust** and **sun pillar** phenomena common at these temps

### Best Tree Zones (Snowboarder-Friendly)
Based on official map + specialist reports:

1. **Tree Run Area III** (newest, opened June 2025)
   - Freshest addition to the resort
   - Likely less tracked than Areas I & II
   - Check signage for specific access points

2. **1,400m Tree Run** (one of Areas I-III)
   - Longest in-bounds tree run in Hokkaido
   - Significant vertical descent
   - Feeds back to lifts
   - ⚠️ Note early closure time (3pm)

3. **Free Area (フリーエリア)**
   - Ungroomed natural terrain
   - More flexibility than numbered areas
   - Operates until 3:20pm (latest of tree zones)

### Powder Strategy
- ✅ **Uncrowded = fresh tracks last longer** (only 30,000 people in entire city!)
- ✅ **Off the gaijin radar** — you'll likely be the only foreigners
- ⚠️ Hit tree areas early (close at 3pm, earlier than main lifts)
- ⚠️ Respect ropes — patrol is strict
- ⚠️ Check trail map at base for tree run entry points

### Cold Weather Strategy
- **DRESS WARM** — This is the coldest resort on our trip
- -20°C to -30°C is possible in early Feb mornings
- Face masks, hand warmers, layering essential
- Take warming breaks at **Log Panorama** (mid-mountain café)
- Onsen access at base = perfect recovery

## Best Runs & Areas

### DON'T MISS
- **The 1,400m Tree Run** — longest in Hokkaido, bucket list item
- **Tree Run Area III** — newest terrain (2025)
- **壁 (The Wall)** — steepest marked run (32° max slope)
- **樹氷コース (Frost Tree Course)** — scenic run through frost-covered trees
- **イースタンコース (Eastern Course)** — can be a powder field if Lift 4 is closed

### BEST FOR SNOWBOARDERS
- Tree areas are spaced well (not too tight)
- Good vertical in tree zones
- Minimal flat sections in advanced terrain

### RECOVERY RUNS
- **一般ゲレンデ第1・第2 (General Slopes 1 & 2)** — mellow cruisers, full vertical
- **ジャイアントコース第1・第2 (Giant Courses 1 & 2)** — wide, groomed intermediates
- **林間コース (Forest Course)** — gentle scenic run through trees

### SKIPPABLE
- Terrain park — described as "primitive" features
- Beginner zone — not our focus

## Gotchas & Quirks

### ❄️ EXTREME COLD
**BIGGEST FACTOR:** Prepare for -20°C to -30°C  
- Coldest resort on our entire trip (latitude 44°N, deep inland)
- "Silky snow" only exists because of these temps
- **Diamond dust** and **sun pillar** phenomena at these temps
- Bring: face masks, neck warmers, hand/toe warmers, layering
- Plan warming breaks every 60-90 minutes

### 🚫 STRICT ROPE POLICY
- Patrol is known to be **hostile** to boundary violations
- "Roped to within an inch of its life" (TGR forums)
- Plenty of in-bounds terrain — no need to duck ropes
- Focus on 4 designated tree areas instead

### ⏰ EARLY TREE RUN CLOSURES
- Tree areas close at **3:00pm** (main lifts run until 4:30pm)
- Plan tree laps for morning/early afternoon
- Don't wait until late day for the 1,400m run

### 🗣️ MINIMAL ENGLISH
- "Barely any English spoken" (Powderhounds)
- Trail map and lunch menus have some English
- Use Google Translate for restaurant orders
- Staff are friendly despite language barrier
- **This is authentic, local Japan** — embrace it!

### 🏔️ SMALL RESORT SCALE
- 3 lifts, 12-13 runs — this is NOT a multi-day destination
- Perfect for 1-2 days (we have 1 day here, 1 day at Horotachi)
- Advanced skiers may find on-piste limiting
- **Tree runs are the main attraction** for our crew

### 🌫️ VISIBILITY
- Extreme cold can create ice fog/diamond dust
- Beautiful but can limit visibility
- Have a flexible plan if conditions are flat light
