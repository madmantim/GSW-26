## Terrain & Access Rules

### Off-Piste Policy
✅ **FULLY ALLOWED** — This is THE place for it!  
- **No rope enforcement** — patrollers won't chase you
- Off-piste and backcountry are the entire point of Kurodake
- ⚠️ **NO AVALANCHE CONTROL** — you're 100% on your own
- Must have proper backcountry gear (beacon, shovel, probe)
- Highly recommended: **hire a guide** (terrain is cliff-riddled and complex)

### Backcountry Access
- **Summit access via skinning** (1,520m chairlift top → 1,984m summit)
- Huge backcountry area beyond summit (Daisetsuzan interior)
- 1-2 day traverse to Asahidake possible for advanced parties
- ⚠️ **NOT FOR US** — need touring gear, ava knowledge, serious experience

### Terrain Zones

**Zone 1: Under the Ropeway (670m-1,300m)**
- Cliff-riddled, very steep tree skiing
- Technical chutes and couloirs
- HARD routefinding — cliffs funnel you into specific lines
- Gets tracked quickly despite low crowds (limited options)
- Some shelter from wind/sun (holds snow quality better)
- ⚠️ **GUIDE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** — wrong turn = cliff/death or brutal hike

**Zone 2: Under the Chairlift (1,300m-1,520m)**
- 2 groomed runs (beginner-friendly)
- Mellow off-piste
- ⚠️ **VERY FLAT** — not ideal for snowboards
- Good views but not worth the trip alone

**Zone 3: Summit Skin Terrain (1,520m-1,984m)**
- Moderately pitched sub-alpine terrain
- Well-spaced trees, fun angle for powder
- More exposed to wind (can get slabby)
- Epic views on bluebird days
- ⚠️ **Backcountry skills required** — no patrol, no control

---

## Hot Tips: Powder Stashes & Tree Runs

### The Reality Check
Kurodake is **not like other Hokkaido resorts**. This is:
- The steepest terrain in Hokkaido
- Unpredictable and often closed
- Requires advanced skills and route-finding
- Best visited with a guide unless you're very experienced

### Powder Strategy
- **Morning weather check is CRITICAL** — ropeway often closed for wind
- If it's running, GO EARLY — tracks fill in fast (despite low crowds)
- Focus on **ropeway terrain** for steep trees and technical lines
- Bring helmet, beacon, shovel, probe — non-negotiable
- **GPS/topo map app recommended** — easy to get lost/cliffed out

### Best Terrain (with guide)
- Tight, steep trees under ropeway — some of the best in Hokkaido (Pete from Powder Project agrees)
- Technical chutes and couloirs
- Every line feels different (intricate terrain)
- Range from "fun-hard" to "hard-hard"

### Snowboarder Notes
- ⚠️ **Chairlift terrain is FLAT** — not ideal for boards
- Ropeway terrain is steep enough but very tight trees (need strong technique)
- If conditions are heavy/crusty, you'll struggle to turn in time to avoid trees
- If you're not confident in tight, steep trees, skip this resort

---

## Best Runs & Areas

### DON'T MISS (if conditions align)
- **Under the ropeway** — this is why you're here
- Summit hike on a bluebird day (views are spectacular)
- Beer Grill Canyon in Sounkyo after (Italian food, war stories)

### SKIPPABLE
- **Chairlift terrain** — unless you're just sightseeing or skinning up

### RECOVERY RUNS
- None. This isn't a recovery resort.

---

## On-Mountain Food

### LUNCH

**Ropeway Top Station Cafeteria** (5th Station, 1,300m)
- Cute little spot with views (on clear days)
- **Menu:** Ramen, katsu curry, gyoza, pancakes
- Basic ski cafeteria fare, but yummy pancakes noted
- ⚠️ **CASH ONLY** — no credit cards

**Alternative:** Bring your own food
- Convenience stores in Sounkyo (Seicomart, 7-Eleven)
- Brown-bag it if you're lapping the ropeway

### DINNER (Sounkyo Town)

**Beer Grill Canyon** (Canyon Mall, town center)
- ⭐ **Top pick** — legendary skier/snowboarder hangout
- Italian restaurant & bar
- Amazing Italian food (wedding-style multi-course gourmet meals)
- Well-priced despite quality
- ⚠️ Beer is good, wine is questionable (stick to beer!)
- Free Wi-Fi
- **The place** to swap powder stories

**Hotel dining:**
- Most hotels offer half-board with kaiseki dinners
- Pensions serve simple Japanese dishes
- Limited stand-alone restaurants in Sounkyo

## Group-Specific Notes

### Is This Trip Worth It?

**PROS:**
- If conditions align: some of the best steep tree skiing in Hokkaido
- Almost zero crowds (empty car park = powder heaven)
- Off-piste paradise (no rope enforcement)
- Unique Hokkaido experience (this is NOT typical Japanese skiing)
- Sounkyo Gorge scenery is spectacular

**CONS:**
- High risk of closure (wind, weather, ava conditions)
- Requires advanced skills (not suitable for whole group)
- Needs guide for safety + finding best lines
- 90min drive from Asahikawa (long day trip)
- Limited terrain without skinning

### Decision Framework

**GO if:**
- ✅ Weather is good (check morning-of)
- ✅ Ropeway is confirmed running
- ✅ Fresh snow in last 24-48hrs (makes the drive worth it)
- ✅ We can hire a guide (safety + line knowledge)
- ✅ Group is comfortable with expert terrain

**SKIP if:**
- ❌ Ropeway closed or forecast is bad
- ❌ No fresh snow (tracked steep trees = not fun)
- ❌ Group wants mellow laps (go to Kamui or Pippu instead)
- ❌ Can't secure a guide (safety concern)

### Backup Plan Options (Feb 6)
If Kurodake doesn't pan out:

- **Kamui Ski Links** (40min from Asahikawa) — underrated gem, good tree zones
- **Asahidake (return visit)** — ropeway may be more reliable than Kurodake
- **Otokoyama Sake Brewery day** — tour, tastings, Asahikawa ramen lunch
- **Sounkyo Ice Festival + onsen** — still worth the drive for culture/relaxation

### Snowboarder Considerations
- ⚠️ Chairlift terrain is FLAT (not worth it for boards)
- Ropeway terrain is steep but VERY technical (tight trees)
- Only attempt if:
  - You're very strong in steep, tight trees
  - Snow is light and dry (heavy = hard to turn in time)
  - You're okay with high consequence terrain
- If in doubt, sit this one out and go to Kamui instead

### Suggested Itinerary (Feb 6)

**Plan A: Full Kurodake Day**
- 7:00am: Check weather + ropeway status
- 8:30am: Depart Asahikawa (if conditions good)
- 10:00am: Arrive Kurodake, buy tickets

- 4:00pm: Stop at Otokoyama Sake Brewery
- 5:30pm: Return to hotel
- 6:30pm: Dinner at Sukiyaki Sankousha (already booked)

**Plan B: Kurodake Closed**
- Morning: Kamui Ski Links (40min away)
- Afternoon: Otokoyama Sake Brewery tour + tastings
- Evening: Dinner at Sukiyaki Sankousha

**Plan C: Weather Terrible Everywhere**
