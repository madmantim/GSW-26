## Terrain & Access Rules

### Off-Piste Policy
✅ **ALLOWED** — Tree skiing is actively encouraged!  
- Multiple "in-bounds" tree zones
- Some sidecountry available (not officially marked)
- No pass-pulling for skiing trees within resort boundary
- **Powderhounds says:** "Either side of 'Thrilling Line' is where the real thrills are"

### Sidecountry/Backcountry
- Some sidecountry accessible, but not well-documented
- ⚠️ **Not for us** (we're just here for a quick morning session)

### In-Bounds Trees
- **This is the highlight** — well-spaced trees, powder stashes
- Often untouched due to low crowds (mostly school groups)
- Sheltered and lower elevation = good for stormy days
- Snowboarder-friendly tree spacing

---

## Hot Tips: Powder Stashes & Tree Runs

### Best Tree Zones (Snowboarder-Friendly)
Based on Powderhounds + local beta:

1. **Either side of "Thrilling Line"**
   - Official course is boring (7° average pitch), but the trees are gold
   - Well-spaced, powder holds well
   - Feeds back to main lifts

2. **"In-bounds" tree zones throughout**
   - Not heavily marked, but patrolled
   - Look for natural gaps in tree cover
   - Very few people ski these — you'll likely have them to yourself

3. **Off-piste stashes**
   - Multiple unmarked powder zones
   - Low visitation = fresh tracks hours after snowfall

### Powder Strategy
- 🎿 **Arrive early** — we want first tracks before the school groups
- 🌨️ **Low crowds** — powderhounds report "you'll have the powder all to yourself"
- 🌲 **Focus on trees** — on-piste is tame, trees are where the fun is
- ⚠️ **Gondola closed** — Shuttle 6 gondola is NOT operating 2025-26 season (maintenance)
- 💨 **Wind backup** — lower elevation + sheltered = good option when other resorts blow out

### Terrain Notes
- **On-piste:** 20% beginner, 40% intermediate, 40% "advanced" (but not challenging)
- **Real terrain:** Trees, off-piste, natural features
- **"Expert" runs:** Marketing fluff — one hits 45° for a second, most are easy
- **For us:** Skip the groomers, hunt the trees

---

## Best Runs & Areas

### DON'T MISS
- **Tree zones on both sides of Thrilling Line** — best powder stashes
- **Any in-bounds trees** — uncrowded, great snow
- **Early morning laps** — beat the school groups

### SKIPPABLE
- **Thrilling Line (official course)** — ironically not thrilling (7° average pitch)
- **Beginner zones** — we're here for powder, not learner slopes

### RECOVERY RUNS
- **Intermediate groomers** — easy cruisers if legs are tired from Tomamu
- **Lower elevation runs** — mellow, scenic

---

## Gotchas & Quirks

### ⚠️ GONDOLA CLOSED THIS SEASON
**BIG CHANGE:** Shuttle 6 gondola (6-person) is NOT operating 2025-26 season due to maintenance  
- Sky Station (mountain top building) is also closed
- Lifts operating: Beginners 4 (quad), Dancers 4 (quad), Swingers 2 (double)
- Racers 2 lift is also closed
- **Impact:** Reduced uphill capacity, but less terrain closed (trees still accessible)

### 💀 DESTITUTE TOWN VIBES
- Yubari was a coal-mining town of 120,000, now ~8,000 (mostly elderly)
- Resort has had financial troubles, hotel at base is closed
- "Ghost town" atmosphere in Yubari city
- **Why visit?** You're supporting a struggling community + uncrowded powder!

### 🏨 NO ACCOMMODATION
- Hotel Mount Racey (ski-in/out) is CLOSED
- Hotel Shuparo also closed
- Only option: Hostel Himawari (old school barracks)
- **For us:** N/A — we're staying at Tomamu and leaving after skiing

### 🌦️ WEATHER ADVANTAGE
- **Lower elevation** = less wind holds than higher resorts
- **Sheltered location** = good backup when Tomamu/Furano blow out
- **Stable weather** throughout season (per resort marketing)

### 👥 CROWDS
- Mostly school groups (identically dressed kids)
- Very few foreigners (you'll likely be the only ones)
- **Much less crowded than Niseko** or other famous resorts
- Powder stays fresh longer

## Nearby Attractions (On Travel Path to Asahikawa)

Since we're driving Yubari → Asahikawa after skiing, here are worthwhile stops:

### 🏛️ Yubari Coal Mine Museum
**Distance:** In Yubari city (~10min from resort)  
**Why visit:** Local history, understand the town's rise and fall  
**Time needed:** 30-45 minutes  
**Worth it?** Only if you're into industrial history — otherwise skip to get to Asahikawa

### 🍈 Yubari Melon
**What:** Yubari is famous for insanely expensive melons (¥2-3 million at auction!)  
**In February:** Not melon season (summer crop)  
**Skip it:** Not relevant for winter visit

### 🗺️ Route Options to Asahikawa

**Option 1: Direct Route (Recommended)**
- Yubari → Route 274 → Iwamizawa → Route 12 → Asahikawa
- ~100km, ~1.5-2 hours
- Fastest, well-maintained winter roads

**Option 2: Scenic Route via Furano/Biei**
- Yubari → Furano → Biei → Asahikawa
- ~130km, ~2.5 hours
- **Biei = stunning winter farmland scenery** (patchwork hills, snow-covered fields)
- **Furano = ski town** (we're skiing there Feb 4)
- Worth the extra 30min if weather is clear and we have time

### 🛁 Onsen Stops (On Route)

**Asahikawa Onsen (Destination)**
- Multiple onsen in Asahikawa city
- Save onsen for arrival in Asahikawa (we'll be staying 5 nights there)

**Furano Onsen (If taking scenic route)**
- Several onsen in Furano area
- Only worthwhile if taking Option 2 route

## Group-Specific Notes

### ⏰ Timing Strategy
**This is a transition day** — balance skiing with travel logistics

**Suggested schedule:**
- 7:00am: Breakfast at Tomamu
- 8:00am: Pack cars, check out
- 8:30am: Depart Tomamu
- 10:00am: Arrive Mt Racey (accounting for 1.5hr drive)
- 10:00am-2:00pm: Ski (4 hours)
- 2:00pm: Pack up, depart for Asahikawa
- 4:00pm: Arrive Asahikawa (accounting for 2hr drive)
- 6:30pm: Dinner at こま弦工房 (as per itinerary)

**Alternative:** If fresh snow, ski until 3pm and push dinner back

### Snowboarders
- ✅ Tree spacing is excellent (low-density, natural flow)
- ✅ No flat sections in tree zones
- ✅ Lower elevation = softer snow (less chance of ice)
- ✅ Uncrowded = no speed checks

### Strategy for the Day
**Goals:**
1. ✅ Get a solid 3-4 hours of tree skiing in fresh pow
2. ✅ Efficiently transition from Tomamu to Asahikawa
3. ✅ Arrive in Asahikawa with time to settle before dinner

**What this is NOT:**
- ❌ Not a full-day resort (too small)
- ❌ Not a tourist destination (destitute town)
- ❌ Not a luxury experience (basic facilities)

**What this IS:**
- ✅ Uncrowded powder stash
- ✅ Great tree skiing
- ✅ Logistically smart stop between Tomamu and Asahikawa
- ✅ Authentic "local Japan" experience

### Weather Consideration
- Check Tomamu forecast the night before
- If Tomamu has fresh snow + good visibility, **consider extending Tomamu** and skipping Mt Racey
- If Tomamu is windy/poor visibility, **Mt Racey is the smart play** (lower elevation, sheltered)
- **Flexibility is key** — don't lock into Mt Racey if Tomamu is dumping

## Indy Pass Note

Mount Racey is on the **Indy Pass** (as of 2025-26 season)  
- This may bring more international visitors in future years
- Currently still very local/uncrowded
- Good sign for resort's financial viability
